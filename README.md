# Kicker Bot
To automatically kick Phil from the #pushuptime channel whenever he joins.

# Usage
Clone the repository and run bundle install. Be sure to create a .env file. The .env.sample has information on what tokens are needed. Then simply run client.rb.

# Notes
Bots can't kick so you have to authenticate as yourself. You also can't kick yourself.
